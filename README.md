The ability of neural networks to emulate the brain’s ability to learn by example has gained a lot of attention among scientists
globally, being one of the greatest computational tools ever developed; this network makes decision and draws conclusions even when
presented with incomplete information. It is a very good tool for many numeric as well as non-numeric calculations and is applied to
numerous problems of considerable complexity in many fields, including engineering, psychology, medicinal chemistry, diagnostics,
and pharmaceutical research 1 . ANN is a parallel, distributed information processing structure consisting of processing elements
interconnected via unidirectional signal channels called connections. In simple words, they are computer systems developed to mimic
the operations of the human brain by mathematically modelling its neurophysiologic structure and function 2 . ANN is capable of
simulating neurological processing ability of the human brain. Average human brain contains about 100 billions of neurons with each
neuron being connected with 1000-10,000 connections to others. During the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms, finding an
optimal composition of inclusion complexes can be a difficult task, since both proportion of each component of the carrier mixture
and proportion of drug can significantly affect the complexation properties. Most of the previous studies were conducted with a few
different compositions of carrier mixtures or different drug: carrier ratios, wherein simultaneous variation of the proportions of all
CDs components has been rarely investigated. The prediction of pharmaceutical responses based on ANN is widely accepted. In this
study, ANNs were used as a machine learning technique to evaluate the influence of cyclodextrins (-CD, HP--CD) on dissolution
enhancement of CBS and DTG with and without hydrophilic polymers (PVP K30, PEG 6000 &amp; SOLUPLUS). This chapter mainly
focuses on the optimisation and prediction of the best output in formulation development. The values of the drug and polymer

concentrations are given as inputs. Values of percent drug released at different time points would be used to train the ANN. The ANN
would predict the expected percent release at each sampling time point (based on its learning of the total behaviour of the system and
using computational modelling) and that would be the output. That formulation, for which the difference between the observed percent
release and the expected percent drug release given as output by the ANN is the least among all such values, would be the best
formulation or the optimised product. A trained ANN model was employed to predict the release profile and optimize the formulation
composition based on the percentage of the drug released.
